I realised, how difficult it is for young adults to make a transition from the protected enviornment of a college to a corporate world, where you are pretty much on your own. One of the most ignored and most important field of healthcare is Mental health. The symptoms of someone having an ill mental health are usually not detectable and not everyone realise they have it and end up being more wrecked affecting their quality of life and productivity at workplace.

Quarter-life crisis: It is usually the anxiety one feels about where their life is going. It is usually the uncertainity seen in people between the age of twenty to mid-thirties.

This dataset is from a 2014 survey that measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace.

#### Some questions worth exploring:

How does the frequency of mental health illness and attitudes towards mental health vary by geographic location?
What are the strongest predictors of mental health illness or certain attitudes towards mental health in the workplace?
More information about the dataset: The original dataset is from Open Sourcing Mental Illness.
